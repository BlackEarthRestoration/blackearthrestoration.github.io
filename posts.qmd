### Honoring Arab American Heritage Month: The Arab American National Museum and Al-Hadiqa

Dear Black Earth Restoration Collective,

In celebration of Arab American Heritage Month, we honor the deep cultural, historical, and environmental contributions of Arab American communities in the United States. This month invites us to reflect on the stories, practices, and legacies that have enriched our collective relationship to land, place, and community stewardship.

We are proud to spotlight the [**Arab American National Museum (AANM)**](https://arabamericanmuseum.org/) in Dearborn, Michigan—the first and only museum in the country dedicated to preserving and sharing the Arab American experience. Since opening in 2005, AANM has served as a vital touchstone, connecting communities to Arab American culture and heritage. Through exhibitions, community programming, and collaborations with artists across all mediums, AANM provides a safe space for open dialogue, education, and artistic expression.![](images/ArabAmericanMuseum.png)

Of special note is **Al-Hadiqa, the Arab American Heritage Garden**, and its youth-centered initiative: the [Al-Hadiqa Apprenticeship in Environmental Stewardship](https://arabamericanmuseum.org/event/al-hadiqa-apprenticeship-in-environmental-stewardship/). This three-month summer program invites high school students from the Dearborn/Detroit area to explore environmental justice through the lens of gardening, cultural ecology, and creative storytelling.

Guided by naturalists and educators, apprentices engage in hands-on scientific learning, community-based environmental activism, and the revitalization of SWANA (Southwest Asian and North African) planting practices. But the garden is more than a growing space—it’s a space of restoration. Youth participants create powerful public service announcements that blend environmental stewardship with writing, filmmaking, and advocacy, helping to shape the future of environmental storytelling and action.

Programs like this remind us that restoration is both ecological and cultural. As we move forward in our work with the Black Earth Restoration Collective, Al-Hadiqa offers an inspiring model for community-rooted environmental activism, intergenerational learning, and youth empowerment.

Let us continue to build relationships across communities, uplifting frameworks that center justice, tradition, and transformation.

### Honoring Black History Month: Hazel M. Johnson

Dear Black Earth Restoration Collective,

![](images/HazelJohnson.png){style="float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;" width="200"}

As we celebrate Black History Month, we take this time to honor the profound contributions of Black leaders who have shaped the environmental justice movement, often in the face of systemic barriers. This month is not only a recognition of history but also a call to uplift the legacies of those who fought tirelessly for the health and dignity of their communities.

One such leader is **Hazel M. Johnson** (1935–2011), widely regarded as the “Mother of the Environmental Justice Movement.” A Chicago native and founder of [People for Community Recovery](https://www.peopleforcommunityrecovery.org/our-story/mission-and-people), Johnson’s work exposed the stark realities of environmental racism in Black communities. Living in Altgeld Gardens, a public housing complex on the South Side of Chicago, she witnessed firsthand the devastating health impacts of industrial pollution, toxic waste, and inadequate sanitation in her neighborhood.

Through relentless organizing, Johnson uncovered the link between hazardous waste sites and high rates of cancer and respiratory illness in her community. Her advocacy laid the groundwork for national conversations about environmental justice, pushing for stronger regulations and community-led solutions. She was instrumental in pressuring government agencies to acknowledge and address environmental disparities, and her influence helped shape President Clinton’s 1994 Executive Order on Environmental Justice.

As we continue our work with the **Black Earth Restoration Collective**, let us draw inspiration from Hazel Johnson’s unwavering commitment to justice, community empowerment, and environmental health. Her legacy reminds us that restoration is not just about the land but about the people who call it home. May we carry forward her vision by advocating for equitable restoration and ensuring that Black communities remain at the forefront of environmental healing and resilience.

### Honoring National Native American Heritage Month: Medicine Fish

November 14, 2024

Dear Black Earth Restoration Collective,

As we enter into Native American Heritage Month, we want to celebrate and honor the heritage, history, and continuing vibrance of Native Americans in stewarding cultural and ecological connections with the Earth. As part of this celebration, we’d like to highlight the work of [Medicine Fish](https://www.medicinefish.org/), an incredible community-based non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the wellbeing and cultural connections of youth to the lands of the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin. Executive Director Bryant Waupoose grew up on the Menominee Reservation and confronted poverty, substance and other forms of abuse, and intergenerational trauma that colonialism wrought on the tribe. Through connecting with nature, Bryant found the spiritual and mental healing he sought and wanted to pass this on to the Menominee youth, which sparked him to found Medicine Fish.

Medicine Fish has taken a unique approach to promoting youth wellness; they are helping the youth to re-establish their deep cultural connection with nature through camping, fly-fishing, and restoring the natural environment in their tribal lands. As part of their work, in 2022, Medicine Fish spearheaded the first reintroduction of bison to their ancestral lands since they were nearly driven to extinction in the late 1800s. The bison homecoming was facilitated by Medicine Fish youth, who built the fencing and prepared the land for the bison. The reintroduction of bison helped reinstate the lost cultural connection of the tribe to bison, who the Menominee consider an ancestor. More bison have been reintroduced since then, with the most recent reintroduction being just a few days ago.

Medicine Fish hopes to restore prairie and wetland ecosystems and grow the bison herd as part of their ecological restoration goals, but more importantly, they continue to seek cultural restoration by encouraging youth to connect with the land, helping them to heal physically, emotionally, and spiritually. In doing so, Medicine Fish is making a huge difference in the lives of Menominee Youth, with the by-product being healthy, thriving, restored ecosystems. Medicine Fish’s work reminds us that restoration at its fullest potential goes well beyond restoring the ecology. It includes repairing and healing the intricate cultural connections between the people and the land.

### Honoring Latine/Hispanic Heritage Month: Berta Cáceres

Dear Black Earth Restoration Collective,

![](images/bertacaceres.jpg){style="float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;" width="200"}

As we celebrate Latine/Hispanic Heritage Month, it is a moment to honor the profound contributions of Latine community members to environmental justice, land stewardship, and social change. Not only is this month a time to reflect on heritage but also a call to recognize the contributions of those who have fought to protect our Earth, often at great personal cost. One such figure is Berta Cáceres (1971–2016), a Honduran environmentalist and indigenous rights activist whose work continues to inspire movements across the globe. As a co-founder of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), Cáceres courageously led her community in the fight to protect their land, water, and livelihoods from harmful development projects. Her advocacy for the Lenca people and the defense of the sacred Gualcarque River brought international attention to the struggles of indigenous communities resisting displacement and environmental degradation. Cáceres believed that the defense of the environment was inseparable from the fight for indigenous sovereignty and human rights.

Her leadership not only protected vital ecosystems but also stood as a powerful testament to the deep connection between the earth and those who inhabit it. As we embark on our work with the Black Earth Restoration Collective, may we take inspiration from leaders like Berta Cáceres who have paved the way for community-driven environmental activism. Her vision reminds us of the power of collective action and the importance of preserving the Earth, not only for future generations but for those who call it home today. Let us honor her memory by deepening our commitment to restoring the Earth and protecting its most vulnerable communities.
